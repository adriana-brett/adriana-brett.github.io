          "how": "How they met",
          "story1": "Brett and Adriana met thanks to Cupid’s best invention of the 21st Century, a dating app. Brett was suspicious at first, as Adriana made the first move, he thought to himself, “She’s gorgeous and seems nice, potentially perfect, but she says she lives in London, but is from Bogotá, and is only here for a short time visiting family.” Against his better judgment, Brett decided to ask her out that first day they matched, and told himself, if she turns out to be a scam, a small bit of personal embarrassment would be worth the risk. <br> <br> Thankfully for Brett, Adrianas aunt, Tia Marce, had been encouraging her to go out and meet friends during her time visiting, to entice her to return. This is when Adriana decided to download Hinge, However, Adriana’s standards were high, so she had no interest in the guys who she was receiving likes from, this is when she took matters into her own hands, “There must be some attractive gringuito here in Connecticut, and I am going to find him” She soon came across Bretts profile, and realized she was right, as always. She sent Brett a like, and put her phone down. Within minutes Brett responded to her, and the small talk began. They chatted for a while, and then Brett asked her out that very night.",
          "story2": "They would both agree that the first date went well, and the second and even the third, but the one who really sealed the deal was Bruno, Brett’s dog. he seemed to have approved of Adriana although he was still cautious as he barked and stood over her every time she spoke, but after a while, a long while, he ended up loving her thanks to all the patience and love she gave him since day one. In the back of their minds however, they knew that their time was limited because Adriana had to go back to London only 7 days after they met. This is where the great People's Republic of China comes into play. Due to Covid restrictions, Adriana had to take a Covid test in order to board her flight, so she asked Brett to give her a ride to the doctors office. On the way there, Brett was secretly hoping for a positive result, which would keep her in the US for at least 10 more days; they both later found out that they were hoping for the same result. <br><br> The results were in, and thanks to Wuhan, they were positive. Adriana’s stuck in the US. Now, Brett made his way to the doctors office to take his test, “please be positive, please be positive” he told himself. But when his results came back, they were negative. <br><br> Decision time, does Brett call it quits so as to not put anyone around him at risk? Or does he edit Adriana’s test to look like his own, and tells everyone around him he has Covid? <br><br> He chose option 2, Sorry to anyone affected, especially you, Scott (Brett’s roommate at the time). <br><br> Over the next 2 weeks, Brett and Adriana spent almost every day together, getting to know each other and becoming closer, Brett would say falling in love, but Adriana was fighting these feelings because of the life she had in the UK. (Good try Adriana, we all know how that ended). <br><br> Flash forward a couple months, and then a couple years, and multiple trips across the pond, Brett and Adriana were in love. Adriana had finally agreed to leave the UK and start their life together in the US."

Adrianas sisters, Camila and Carolina, were Bretts accomplices, and they did a great job in organizing a beautiful engagement. During that time Brett had chosen the song that was going to play during the proposal, invited most of Adriana’s family and friends and chose a very special date in Adriana’s life. The time had come, but Adriana wasn’t cooperating with the plan that Camila, Carolina, and Brett had come up with. <br><br> Back to the drawing board, the sisters secretly spoke to each other when Adriana wasn’t around (a harder task than you would think as she sticks to her sisters like glue) and came up with a plan that they thought she would actually agree to.",
          "prop3": "They would arrive at Parque de los Novios, and Camila would ask Adriana to accompany her to the bathroom as Brett snuck away with Carolina to the spot of the proposal. Unfortunately, Adriana did not want to go with her, as she wanted to show Brett around the park. <br><br> The soon to be engaged couple instead walked together, and as they came around the side of a hill, Adriana saw the decorations and the large letters that read “ Marry me”. “Oh look how pretty” she said, as Brett asked, “You don’t know who this is for?”. This is when the tears started for Adriana, and the wind picked up and blew dust into Bretts eyes, causing them to water uncontrollably. Brett got down on one knee, and in front of the majority of Adrianas family in Bogota, they were now engaged.",
